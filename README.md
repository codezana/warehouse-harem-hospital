# 🚀 WareHouse Harem Hospital

### 💡 Description  
During my university studies, I worked on this project, which was implemented for the Regional Hospital’s accounting department.
Their work process was very difficult and time-consuming for the staff, especially for other departments in the hospital when they
needed something from accounting. Therefore, we successfully completed this project for them, and fortunately, we received positive 
feedback about how it improved their workflow.
